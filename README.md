## How to initiate new react project

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system
2. Install pnpm globally if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
3. Create a new React project using Vite:
   ```bash
   cd projects
   pnpm create vite {ProjectName} --template react
   ```
4. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd {ProjectName}
   ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

Your React application will be running at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
